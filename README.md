# Roaree Benchmark Club 🦁

**Columbia University's Invite-Only LLM Benchmark Initiative**

Roaree Benchmark is a student-led research group inspired by Columbia's mascot (the Lion), focused on benchmarking and evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI systems. This is an **invite-only** collaborative space for vetted students from Columbia University and select external contributors working on responsible AI assessment and transparency.

## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is to develop rigorous, transparent, and reproducible benchmarks for evaluating LLM capabilities, limitations, and safety characteristics. We aim to advance the field of AI evaluation through collaborative research and open scientific discourse.
